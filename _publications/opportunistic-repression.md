title: "Opportunistic Repression: Civilian Targeting by the State in Response to COVID-19"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/opportunistic-repression
excerpt: 'Summary: We propose opportunistic repression as a framework for understanding repression under authoritarian regimes. We test our argument by studying patterns of state violence against civilians in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created a window of opportunity for dictators to use force against opposition figures under the auspice of public health.'
