excerpt: 'Rebel organizations regularly provide public services, even as they primarily focus on fighting. Existing scholarship documents many predictors of insurgent services, but the theoretical mechanisms for, and downstream effects of, these activities remain unclear. This study examines Taliban courts in Afghanistan, theorizing that judicial services create a vested interest in Taliban rule and show governance capacity. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that Taliban courts significantly reduced the frequency of major interpersonal disputes, especially around property, in districts where they operated. We find a corresponding reduction in citizen willingness to use government courts, and higher approval for Taliban rule. Lastly, the Taliban were able to conduct increased bombings and other attacks against government and foreign troops after they introduced local courts. The results indicate that competent rebel courts can significantly sway public opinion and enhance rebel fighting capacity. These findings also help to explain the Taliban's rapid takeover of Afghanistan in the wake of foreign withdrawal.'
