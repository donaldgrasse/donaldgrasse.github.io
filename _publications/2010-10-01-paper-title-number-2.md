excerpt: 'When do agricultural transformations impact social stability? Cash crops are typically
associated with economic prosperity and social peace. I argue agricultural booms
may spur violent conflict over resource allocation by pitting would-be producers against
incumbent landowners when the gains from production are concentrated and the negative
externalities are diffuse. I study the rapid expansion of oil palm in Indonesia, a
growingly important crop in the global economy. I find when oil palm grows more valuable
and expands within producing districts, violent resource conflicts increase. The
positive relationship does not exist for other cash crops, nor other types of conflict, and
is moderated by the presence of sustainability certified processing mills. The results
connect commodity shocks to non-state violence over resources, and suggest land use
change is an important mechanism connecting agricultural booms to social conflict.'
