Regression is perhaps the most ubiquitous tool for quantitive analysis in the social sciences. Why? What can it be used for, how can we interpret results, when do its assumptions fail, and what can analysts do if the core assumptions no longer hold? This course will answer all of these questions by providing building blocks for causal modeling, the multiple motivations of linear regression, modifications required for limited dependent variables (logistic regression), how it operates in the presence of covariates (moderation, mediation), examine its various use cases for drawing inferences from data (selection on observables, instrumental variables, panel data and differencing) while providing students with practical lessons on statistical programming.
