Welcome! I research institutions and armed conflict: the impact of state institutions on nonstate actors, how violent organizations build their own institutions to compete with the state and control civilains, and the institutional legacies of armed conflict, including peace negotiations and transitional justice. My work utilizes in-depth qualitative knowledge to inform causal research designs with observational data. My research has been published in the _American Political Science Review_, _International Organization_, the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_, and is forthcomming in the _British Journal of Political Science_. 

Currently, I am a visiting assistant professor in Intenational Relations and Methodology at Cornell University. Previously, I was a visting instructor for M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) at the University of Chicago and a Political Economy of Security Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Southern California.
