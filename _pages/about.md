Welcome! I research political violence and state development, with a focus on resource conflicts, legacies of violence, and human rights. My work examines how states and non-state actors navigate conflict, repression, and justice, and how historical legacies, resource politics, and institutional choices shape civilian experiences in times of crisis and transition. My research has been published in the _American Political Science Review_, _Journal of Politics_, and _International Organization_. 

Currently, I am an Assistant Instructional Professor at the University of Chicago. I teach courses on research methodology and security studies. Contact me at dgrasse[at]uchicago[dot]edu.
