Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California's Center for International Studies. Prior to this appointment, I was recieved my PhD in political science at Emory University. 

My research is in the political economy of development and conflict. My work focuses on the persistent effects of institutionalized violence, the political economy of insurgency, the relationship between natural resource abundance and social peace, and peace-building and transitional justice in societies mired by conflict. My work utilizes in-depth qualitative knowledge to inform causal research designs with observational data. My research has been conditionally accepted to the _American Political Science Review_ and published in the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_ and _International Security_.
