Welcome! I research the political economy of conflict in developing countries. My work focuses on the persistent effects of institutionalized violence, the political economy of insurgency, the relationship between natural resource abundance and social peace, and peace-building/transitional justice in societies mired by conflict. My work utilizes in-depth qualitative knowledge to inform causal research designs with observational data. My research has been published in the _American Political Science Review_, _International Organization_, and the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_. 

Currently, I am a visting instructor for M.S. in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) at the University of Chicago. I am teaching an advanced course in Database Management. Contact me at dgrasse[at]uchicago[dot]edu.
