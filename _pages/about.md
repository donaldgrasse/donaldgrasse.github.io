Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California's Center for International Studies. Prior to this appointment, I was recieved my PhD in political science at Emory University. 

My research is in the political economy of development and conflict. I study the long-run effects of institutional violence, the political economy of counter insurgency, and the relationship between natural resources and economic development. My work has been conditionally accepted to the _American Political Science Review_ and published in the _Journal of Conflict Resolution_ and _International Security_.
